= Bolt Protocol

The Bolt network protocol is a highly efficient, lightweight client-server
protocol designed for database applications.

The protocol is statement oriented, allowing a client to send statements, each
consisting of a single string and a set of typed parameters. The server
responds to each request with a result message and an optional stream of result
records.

This documentation describes the various versions of the Bolt Protocol, for the
use by anyone implementing client or server applications. It is licensed under
https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/[Creative Commons 3.0 Attribution-ShareAlike],
and was originally authored by the team behind the https://neo4j.com[Neo4j graph database].

The current version is link:v1/[Protocol Version 1].

== Connection

All versions of the Bolt Protocol operate over a TCP connection or WebSocket,
with an optional TLS encapsulation. The recommended default port is 7687.

== Protocol version negotiation

All connections will begin with protocol version negotiation, described in the
link:v1/#handshake[handshake documentation].

== Contributing

Bolt is a non-standardized open source protocol and contributions are encouraged.

Contributions to this website and the documentation can be made via the
